## USP-ESALQ
The following branch contains the codebase developed as part of a research project at USP-ESALQ exploring the design and evaluation of **parallelized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines** using Apache Airflow. It investigates how Airflow DAGs can be structured to support modularity, scalability, and high throughput in workflows, especially in environments with heavy computational demands.
